> A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that adds features to a network between services. It allows to control traffic and gain insights throughout the system. Observability, traffic shifting (for canary releasing), resiliency features (such as circuit breaking and retry/timeout) and automatic mutual TLS can be configured once and enforced in a decentralized fashion. In contrast to libraries, which are used for similar functionality, a service mesh does not require code changes. Instead, it adds a layer of additional containers that implement the features reliably and agnostic to technology or programming language.

服务网格是一个专用的基础设施层，为服务间的网络增加功能。它允许控制流量并获得整个系统的洞察力。可观察性、流量转移（用于金丝雀发布）、弹性功能（如熔断和重试/超时）和自动双向TLS可以一次配置并以非中央化的方式执行。与用于类似功能的类库相比，服务网格不需要修改代码。相反，它增加了一层额外的容器，可靠地实现这些功能，并且和技术或编程语言无关。

> The value of a service mesh grows with the number of services an application consists of. Logically, microservices architectures are the most common use cases for a service mesh. However, the specific interaction might be more relevant in regards to how a service mesh can improve the control, reliability, security, and observability of the services. Even a monolith could benefit from a service mesh and some concrete microservice applications might not.

服务网格的价值随着应用程序所包含的服务数量而增长。从逻辑上讲，微服务架构是服务网格最常见的用例。然而，对于服务网格如何改善服务的控制、可靠性、安全性和可观察性，具体的交互可能更有意义。即使是单体也可以从服务网格中受益，而一些具体的微服务应用可能不会。
