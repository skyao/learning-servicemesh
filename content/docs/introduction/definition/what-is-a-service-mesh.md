  William Morgan的博客文章给出的servicemesh的权威定义
---



> A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication. It’s responsible for the reliable delivery of requests through the complex topology of services that comprise a modern, cloud native application. In practice, the service mesh is typically implemented as an array of lightweight network proxies that are deployed alongside application code, without the application needing to be aware. (But there are variations to this idea, as we’ll see.)

服务网是一个专用的基础设施层，用于处理服务间通信。现代云原生应用程序有着复杂的服务拓扑，服务网格负责在这些拓扑中实现请求的可靠传递。在实践中，服务网格通常实现为一组轻量级网络代理，它们与应用程序代码部署在一起，而对应用程序透明。(但这个想法也有变化，我们会看到的）
